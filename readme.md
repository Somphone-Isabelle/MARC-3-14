## Storyline
    2028: A very intense solar storm has just hit... The MARC MArs Rover Cartograph rover, which was carrying out its mission very well, has suffered a malfunction. Its programming, guidance and movement systems have been seriously affected...
    The ESTF, Efrei Space Task Force, has called on programming experts to design new travel software for MARC.
    Your mission is to use this travel software to brinng MARC back to a base station where it can be refurbished.

## Our vision
    For an optimized trial of our program, our main file gives access to a menu composed of the following choices :
        1. Get the location of the rover
            this option redirects the user to the function "blah" that does "blah"
        2. Display the map
            this option redirects the user to the function "blah" that does "blah"
        3. Get the sequence of the moves
            this option redirects the user to the function "blah" that does "blah"
        4. Get the best sequence possible
            this option redirects the user to the function "blah" that does "blah"
        5. Exit
            This option stops the execution of the program completely, allowing the rover to get a day off.

## Conclusion
    This practical helped us understand how to implement tree structures, understand complexity and how lists can be used in a working environment.
    Thank you for assisting us during this project and we hope you aprreciated it !
